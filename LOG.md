# Actual time to complete assignment
| Date | Time Started | Time Spent | Work completed |
| :--: | -----------: | ---------: | :------------- |
| 04/17 |      3:00pm |       0:30 | read assignment and wrote out potential challenges/obstacles on paper. |
| 04/18 |      4:00pm |       2:00 | outlined key strategies for each function that needed to be implemented, then tried to convert this higher level thinking into pseudocode |
| 04/19 |      9:00pm |       2:00 | implemented higher level code (outlined above) within functions. What was especially difficult was the syntax, so having the lecture code open helped a lot. |
| 04/19 |      11:00pm |       1:00 | In a similar vein to last pset, created and tested private test cases on the Zoo. There was very little structural debugging--was mostly syntactic (or forgetting to change node->left to node->right after copy and pasting similar (but reversed) functions like right and left rotate) . |


# Collaboration
I discussed my solution with no one.

# Discussion
I really enjoyed this PSET. Unfortunately, midterms piled up this week so I had to use a couple of late days, and then I completely forgot to submit (hence why I am submitting now)!! That is very frustrating. But that aside, I thought this was a very fair challenge. It really helped me think about the binary tree content we have been covering in class whil not being so challenging as to confuse me more about this already novel topic. Overall, I enjoyed this PSET a lot! It was very informative and has prepared me well for next week.
